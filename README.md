# shopping_list_

This exercise has been done by me (with some changes) from the course "The Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery". 
The challenge was:

1. If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done class on and off.

2. Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its corresponding delete button.

3. BONUS: When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the delete button next to it (hint: be sure to check if new items are clickable too!)
